<h1 align="center">Monad Transformers</h1>

## Transformers are split into 2 groups:
  - Error MonadTs: ErrorT, EitherT, MaybeT - the three error handlers which have similar implementations
  - Stately MonadTs: StateT, WriterT, ReaderT - the three monads with some concept of state, similar implementations (have many lambda functions)
